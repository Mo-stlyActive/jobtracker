# üöÄ Deploy JobTracker to GitHub

## Method 1: Using GitHub Website (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right ‚Üí **"New repository"**
3. Fill in repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `jobtracker` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `Professional Job Application Management System - Track applications, analyze performance, and optimize your job search strategy`
   - **Visibility**: Choose **Public** (recommended for sharing) or **Private**
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### Step 2: Push Your Local Repository
After creating the empty repository on GitHub, you'll see instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jobtracker.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/jobtracker` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.**

### Step 3: Verify Upload
1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all files including the README.md
3. GitHub will automatically display the README as the project homepage

## Method 2: Using GitHub CLI (If Available)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Create repository and push in one command
gh repo create jobtracker --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# Or for private repository
gh repo create jobtracker --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```
